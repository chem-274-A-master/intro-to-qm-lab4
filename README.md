# Intro to Quantum Chemistry Lab

This lab is an introduction to running quantum chemistry calculations, and broadly what they are about.

There is a brief presentation about what quantum chemistry is, the common methods, and why
quantum chemistry is done over classical simulations like you have been doing.


## Installation

For running calculations, you need to install psi4 and other packages.
Create a conda environment using the environment file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This creates an environment called "intro-qm-lab". Activate it with:

```bash
conda activate intro-qm-lab
```

Then open the jupyter notebook.
